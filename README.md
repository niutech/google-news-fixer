Google News Fixer
=================

This Chrome extension allows you to customize the new Google News front page by adding your favorite topics, locations, sources and saved searches to it, as well as removing unnecessary topics from it, like: Headlines, For you, U.S., World, Business, Technology, Entertainment, Sports, Science or Health. You can choose what to hide in the extension options.

## How it works

After opening the front page of [news.google.com](https://news.google.com/), Google News Fixer fetches favorite topics, locations, sources and saved searches asynchronously in the background. Then it appends them to the news feed as sections with a clickable title. The extension also hides standard sections specified in the options and saved in `chrome.storage`. This is not so trivial as it sounds, due to Google News being an obfuscated and highly dynamic web app.

## Notice

This extension is in beta stage, it is provided "as is" and it is not affiliated with Google.
